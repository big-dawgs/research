### Project Finalization - 

#### Idea 1: Style Transfer on Camouflaged Images

**Datasets**

- CAMO++ - https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia/research/camo_plus_plus
- COD10K - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/getcam/cod10k

**Papers**

- Camouflage Detection - https://paperswithcode.com/paper/highly-accurate-dichotomous-image
- Style Transfer - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01414v1

**Novelty**

-  Style transfer with camouflaged images is a novel application. It would be interesting to see how camouuflaged animals can appear in different environments.

#### Idea 2: Tabla Music Notes Prediction

**Datasets**

- Tabla Solo Dataset - https://compmusic.upf.edu/tabla-solo-dataset

**Papers** 

- https://magenta.tensorflow.org/transcription-with-transformers

**Novelty**

- No model has been created yet for Indian Classical Instruments. Moreover, the number of recordings is very less, so this would be a challenging problem. We might have to generate dataset for this problem.
