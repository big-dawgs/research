### Project Ideas - 2

1. What are the features a pharmacist looks at while reading prescriptions?
- Medical prescription OCR
- Work already exists - _pixdyanmics.com_
- Papers also available
- Not too much use case :(

2. Traffic Signal Identification for Self Driving Cars
- data will be hard to find
- seems promising
- data collection strategies need more thinking

3. Handwritten equations in chemistry 

4. Classical Dance Type Identification

5. NLP for hindi, or other indic languages.

### Discard

1. ~~Can we find which car is honking with mics and cameras? - noise isolation.~~
- seems not feasible because many mics are needed

2. ~~Driving in rains for self driving cars~~
- data is a problem

3. ~~OCR for Indian Local Languages~~
- a lot of literature available
- idea is overdone
